## 📊 Progress Tracking

**Overall Progress**: 0/20 tasks completed (0%)

### By Category:
- **Foundation Layer**: 0/3 tasks (0%)
- **UI/UX Implementation**: 0/3 tasks (0%) 
- **Core Features**: 0/6 tasks (0%)
- **Infrastructure & Performance**: 0/8 tasks (0%)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Ambient Intelligence"

All tasks should follow the **Ambient Intelligence** design philosophy:
- **Flow State Protection**: Gentle, non-intrusive interactions
- **Vibe-Centric Design**: Emotional state awareness and celebration
- **AI-Context Awareness**: Deep integration with AI development workflows
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-optimized responsive design

## 🔗 Key Dependencies

Tasks have the following dependency structure:
1. **Foundation Layer** → All other tasks depend on this
2. **UI/UX Implementation** → Required for Core Features
3. **Core Features** → Can be developed in parallel after UI/UX
4. **Infrastructure** → Final layer, requires completed features

## 📝 Task Completion Guidelines

For each task:
1. ✅ **Review requirements** and technical specifications
2. 🔧 **Implement** following provided code examples
3. 🧪 **Test** with unit and integration tests
4. 📱 **Validate** mobile responsiveness
5. ⚡ **Optimize** for performance targets
6. 📖 **Document** implementation and usage

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete When**:
- [ ] All 20 tasks implemented and tested
- [ ] PWA passes Lighthouse audit (90+ score)
- [ ] Core user journey functional end-to-end
- [ ] Mobile experience fully responsive
- [ ] Real-time features working reliably
- [ ] AI context monitoring operational
- [ ] Beta deployment ready
