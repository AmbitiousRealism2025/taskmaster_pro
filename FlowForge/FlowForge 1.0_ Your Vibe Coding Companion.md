You're absolutely right \- let's scale back to a focused 1.0 that's actually buildable and useful as a daily companion. Here's a simplified version that mirrors TaskSlayer Pro's core features but adapted for vibe coders:

## **FlowForge 1.0: Your Vibe Coding Companion**

*A simple, focused productivity app that sits alongside your AI coding sessions*

---

### **Core Features (Matching TaskSlayer Pro's Structure)**

## **‚ú® Dashboard**

* **Today's Focus**: Single "main thing" you're shipping today (not a task list)  
* **Active Session**: Current AI model, time remaining in context window (5-hour Claude blocks)  
* **Ship Streak**: Days in a row you've deployed something  
* **Vibe Meter**: Simple green/yellow/red for your current flow state  
* **Quick Capture**: One-click to save an idea without context switching

## **üìù Sessions (Replaces Tasks)**

* **Session Types**: "Building", "Exploring", "Debugging", "Shipping"  
* **AI Context**: Which model you're using (Claude, GPT, Cursor)  
* **Context Health**: Visual timer showing when to refresh (2-3 hour warning)  
* **Checkpoint Notes**: Quick notes about what's working/not working  
* **Status**: "Flowing", "Stuck", "Shipped", "Abandoned" (it's okay to abandon\!)

## **üéØ Projects (Simplified)**

* **Project Cards**: Visual cards showing current experiments  
* **Progress Bar**: Based on "feels right" percentage, not task completion  
* **Ship Date**: Target launch date (flexible, not a deadline)  
* **Stack Note**: Which AI tools/models work best for this project  
* **Pivot Counter**: Celebrates exploration, shows how many times you've changed direction

## **üîÑ Habits (Vibe Coder Specific)**

* **Daily Ship**: Did you deploy anything today?  
* **Context Refresh**: Did you start fresh AI conversations when needed?  
* **Code Review**: Did you actually read what the AI generated?  
* **Backup Check**: Did you commit before major changes?  
* **Flow Block**: Did you get uninterrupted creative time?  
* Simple streak tracking with satisfying animations

## **üìì Notes (Context Preservation)**

* **Prompt Patterns**: Save successful prompts that worked  
* **"Golden Code"**: Snippets that worked perfectly first try  
* **Debug Log**: What broke and how you fixed it (or rerolled it)  
* **Model Notes**: Which AI works best for what  
* Links to specific sessions and projects

## **üìÖ Calendar View**

* **Flow Blocks**: Schedule your 2-4 hour creative sessions  
* **Ship Targets**: Soft deadlines for launching  
* **Context Resets**: Reminders to start fresh conversations  
* **Energy Patterns**: Heat map of when you ship the most  
* No meeting integration \- this is your creative calendar only

## **üìä Analytics (Vibe-Focused)**

* **Ship Rate**: How often you deploy vs. how often you code  
* **Flow Score**: Quality creative hours (not total hours)  
* **Model Performance**: Which AI helps you ship fastest  
* **Reroll Rate**: How often you regenerate vs. debug  
* **Best Shipping Times**: When you're most likely to complete projects

## **‚è±Ô∏è Focus Mode**

* **Claude Timer**: 5-hour countdown for context limits  
* **Session Timer**: 2-3 hour blocks with "freshness" warnings  
* **Break Enforcer**: Prevents AI-induced frustration spirals  
* **Ambient Mode**: Optional background sounds/music  
* **Emergency Save**: One-click to preserve everything before context switch

### **What Makes This Different from TaskSlayer Pro**

**Instead of:**

* Task priorities (High/Medium/Low) ‚Üí Session vibes (Flowing/Exploring/Stuck)  
* Due dates ‚Üí Ship targets (flexible, celebratory)  
* Task completion % ‚Üí "Feels done" slider  
* Time tracking ‚Üí Context health monitoring  
* Productivity score ‚Üí Ship streak  
* Subtasks ‚Üí Checkpoint notes  
* Task templates ‚Üí Prompt patterns

**Unique to Vibe Coders:**

* AI context management built into every feature  
* Reroll tracking instead of debug logging  
* Flow state protection as core principle  
* Shipping celebration over task completion  
* Context degradation warnings  
* Model performance tracking

---

### **Simple, Clean, Focused**

This 1.0 version:

* **Runs alongside** your coding environment as a companion  
* **Tracks what matters**: AI context health, flow states, and shipping  
* **Protects your creativity** without adding complexity  
* **Celebrates shipping** over process completion  
* **Adapts to vibe coding** workflows without forcing structure

It's essentially TaskSlayer Pro's clean simplicity, but every feature is reimagined for someone who codes through conversation with AI rather than writing code directly. The same satisfying progress tracking, but measuring creative flow instead of task completion.
