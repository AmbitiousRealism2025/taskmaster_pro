# FlowForge 1.0 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Document Type:** Product Requirements Document  
**Target Platform:** Progressive Web App → iOS/Android Mobile Apps

---

## Executive Summary

**Product Vision:** FlowForge transforms how AI-assisted developers track and optimize their productivity by focusing on shipping velocity and flow states rather than traditional task completion metrics, providing the missing analytics for the age of AI-driven development.

**Market Opportunity:** The global developer tools market is projected to reach $26.4 billion by 2027, with a significant gap in productivity tools designed specifically for AI-assisted development workflows. FlowForge addresses the unique needs of developers who practice "vibe coding" - using AI conversations to build software rather than writing code directly.

**Success Criteria:** 1,000 beta users within 30 days, 50% week-over-week growth in early months, and $100K ARR by month 12, establishing FlowForge as the category-defining productivity companion for AI-assisted developers.

---

## 1. Market Context and Strategic Positioning

### Target Market Analysis
The primary market consists of **AI-First Developers** (25-40 years old, 3-10+ years experience) who use AI assistants daily and struggle with traditional productivity metrics that don't capture their actual shipping velocity and flow states.

**Market Gap:** No existing tool specifically addresses AI-assisted development workflows, where context management, flow state protection, and shipping frequency are more important than traditional task completion metrics.

### Competitive Landscape
- **Direct Competitors:** Clockify, RescueTime (time tracking focus, no AI awareness)
- **Adjacent Competitors:** Notion, Linear (task-focused, missing flow state tracking)
- **Market Opportunity:** First-mover advantage in AI-native productivity tools

### Value Proposition
"The only productivity companion that understands AI-assisted development, tracking what actually matters: flow states, context health, and shipping velocity instead of task completion."
