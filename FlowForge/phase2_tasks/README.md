## 🎨 Mobile Design Philosophy

All Phase 2 tasks should prioritize:
- **Touch-First**: 44px minimum touch targets, gesture navigation
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without network connection
- **Performance-First**: <3s load time, <200ms interaction response
- **Native-Feel**: Platform-specific UI patterns and behaviors

## 🔗 Key Dependencies

Phase 2 task dependencies:
1. **Phase 1 Complete** → Required for all Phase 2 tasks
2. **Mobile Design** → Required for PWA features and performance optimization
3. **PWA Features** → Required for app store preparation
4. **Performance Mobile** → Final optimization before store submission

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Success Criteria

**Phase 2 Complete When**:
- [ ] PWA installable on iOS and Android
- [ ] All core features work offline
- [ ] Touch gestures implemented throughout
- [ ] Push notifications functional
- [ ] App store review guidelines met
- [ ] Beta testing program launched
- [ ] Performance targets achieved on mobile
