- **Performance**: 45+ tests (network, battery, memory, touch)
- **Store Prep**: 45+ tests (native builds, iOS, Android, compliance)

## 🎯 FlowForge-Specific Test Features

### Core Philosophy Testing
- **Flow State Protection**: Tests ensure mobile optimizations don't disrupt developer flow
- **AI Context Health**: Mobile-specific AI context monitoring and alerts
- **Vibe Coding**: Touch-optimized workflows for AI-assisted development
- **Ambient Intelligence**: Non-intrusive mobile interactions

### Unique Mobile Requirements
- **Haptic Feedback**: Flow state transitions with appropriate haptic patterns
- **Context Health Alerts**: Smart notifications that respect deep flow states
- **Touch Performance**: <16ms response times for gesture interactions
- **Battery Awareness**: AI processing throttling based on battery level
- **Privacy-First**: Secure local storage of AI context and session data

## 📝 Test Structure

Each test file follows consistent structure:
- **Setup/Teardown**: Mock mobile APIs and reset state
- **Task-Specific Tests**: Organized by individual tasks (21-36)
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-feature testing scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks and timing validations
- **Compliance Tests**: Store submission requirements

## 🔧 Mock Implementations

Tests include comprehensive mocking for:
- **Capacitor APIs**: Native bridge, plugins, device capabilities
- **Mobile APIs**: Touch events, haptic feedback, battery status
- **PWA APIs**: Service Worker, Push Manager, IndexedDB
- **Store APIs**: App Store Connect, Play Console validation

## 📱 Mobile-First Testing Approach

### Touch & Gesture Testing
- Touch target size validation (minimum 44px)
- Multi-touch gesture recognition
- Swipe navigation with flow state protection
- Haptic feedback timing and intensity

### Performance Testing
- Network request batching and optimization
- Memory usage monitoring and cleanup
- Battery consumption measurement
- Touch response time validation (<16ms)

### Offline Testing
- Background sync queue management
- IndexedDB storage and encryption
- Service Worker lifecycle management
- Network state awareness and adaptation

## 🏪 Store Readiness Testing

### iOS App Store
- Xcode project configuration validation
- App Store Connect metadata compliance
- Human Interface Guidelines adherence
- TestFlight beta testing setup

### Google Play Store
- Android App Bundle optimization
- Play Console metadata validation
- Material Design compliance
- Store listing ASO optimization

## ✅ Success Criteria

**All Phase 2 tests pass when:**
- Mobile UI components are touch-optimized (44px+ targets)
- PWA functions fully offline with background sync
- Performance meets targets (<3s load, <16ms touch response)
- Native builds generate valid iOS/Android apps
- Store metadata and assets pass validation
- Privacy policies cover AI data handling
- Cross-platform feature parity is maintained

## 🔄 Implementation Workflow

1. **Run Tests**: All tests should fail initially (TDD red phase)
2. **Implement Features**: Build mobile components to pass tests (green phase)
3. **Refactor & Optimize**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage (refactor phase)
4. **Validate Mobile**: Test on actual iOS/Android devices
5. **Store Submission**: Use test validation for app store approval
