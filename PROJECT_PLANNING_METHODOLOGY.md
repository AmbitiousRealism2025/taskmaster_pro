## Methodology Overview

### The Core Philosophy
**"Plan Completely, Document Thoroughly, Compact Regularly, Then Build"**

Our methodology follows a waterfall approach for planning but enables agile implementation. Every aspect of the system is thought through, documented, and tested (via failing tests) before any implementation begins.

### Timeline Summary
- **Week 1**: Product analysis and TDD planning
- **Week 2**: Test creation and phase breakdown
- **Week 3**: Context documentation creation (with compaction)
- **Week 4**: Review, enhancement, and workflow organization
- **Result**: Complete blueprint ready for 12-week implementation

---

## Phase 1: Initial Analysis & Understanding

### Step 1.1: Product Documentation Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand the complete scope and requirements

**Process**:
1. Analyzed existing product specifications in `taskmaster_pro_docs/`
2. Reviewed UI mockups and examples
3. Identified core features and user workflows
4. Mapped technical requirements to features

**Deliverables**:
- Mental model of complete system
- Feature priority matrix
- Technical requirement list

### Step 1.2: Technology Stack Selection
**Purpose**: Choose appropriate tools for requirements

**Decisions Made**:
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- UI Components: shadcn/ui with Radix primitives
- State: TanStack Query (server), Zustand (client)
- Backend: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Testing: Vitest, Playwright, Testing Library
- AI: OpenRouter/BYOK integration

**Rationale**: Modern, proven technologies with excellent TypeScript support and community backing

### Step 1.3: Architecture Design
**Purpose**: Define system structure and patterns

## Phase 5: Organization & Workflow Design

### Step 5.1: The Compaction Workflow Innovation
**Purpose**: Prevent context window overflow during implementation

**Problem Solved**: 
- Large projects overflow context windows
- Work gets lost or corrupted
- Difficult to maintain quality across long implementation

**Solution: 12-Point Compaction Workflow**
```
For Each Subgroup (1-12):
┌────────────────────┐
│ 1. Start Fresh     │ (Context <10%)
│ 2. Load Docs       │ (Context ~20%)
│ 3. Implement       │ (Context ~40%)
│ 4. Test            │ (Context ~50%)
│ 5. Document        │ (Context ~60%)
│ 6. COMPACT         │ (Reset to ~0%)
└────────────────────┘
```

### Step 5.2: Implementation Guide Creation
**Purpose**: Clear roadmap for development

**Created Documents**:
1. `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Master plan with compaction points
2. `IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md` - Detailed step-by-step process
3. `SUBGROUP_PROGRESS.md` - Progress tracking template
4. `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` - Document relationship guide
5. `PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Readiness verification

### Step 5.3: Documentation Organization
**Purpose**: Logical structure for easy navigation

**Final Structure**:
```
TaskMaster_Pro/
├── Implementation Guides (5 files)
├── Test Files (3 files, 165 tests)
├── context_docs/
│   ├── phase1/ (5 docs)
│   ├── phase2/ (3 docs)
│   ├── phase3/ (4 docs)
│   ├── security_enhancements/ (6 docs)
│   ├── performance_optimizations/ (4 docs)
│   └── architecture_improvements/ (3 docs)
└── Reference Docs
```

### Step 5.4: Implementation Notes Headers
**Purpose**: Quick reference for each subgroup

**Added to Each Context Doc**:
- Subgroup number and description
- Compaction requirement reminder
- Test coverage reference
- Dependencies list
- Related enhancements
- Estimated context usage

### Step 5.5: Final Documentation Updates
