# TaskMaster Pro — Product Description

TaskMaster Pro is a full-stack productivity OS for solopreneurs and small teams that unifies **Tasks, Projects, Notes, Habits, Calendar, Analytics, and a Focus Mode** into one elegant, low-friction workflow.  
From the screenshots, the product’s personality is **calm, card-based, gradient-accented**, with light/dark parity, top-nav modules, and quick actions. TaskMaster Pro extends that UI with **agentic helpers**: turn any note into actionable tasks, auto-prioritize a day plan, and nudge habit completion—all while keeping data local-first with cloud sync.

**Core differentiators**
- **Agent-assisted planning.** MCP-powered agents extract tasks from notes, calendar invites, or web pages and slot them on your schedule.
- **Focus Mode with accountability.** Timed sessions tied to a single task; auto-log work, streaks, and progress to analytics.
- **Habit loops linked to goals.** Habits can be attached to projects and tasks, powering outcome-driven streaks (not vanity counts).
- **Cross-module analytics.** Completion rate, daily task velocity, time tracked, and productivity score—explained, not just graphed.
- **Composable integrations.** BYOK LLM and pluggable MCP servers (e.g., Playwright MCP, Context7 MCP) for capture, search, and automation.
