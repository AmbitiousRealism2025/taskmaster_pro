# TaskMaster Pro — Design System Notes

- **Cards & surfaces:** 2xl radius, soft drop shadows, generous 16–24px spacing, glassy gradients for CTAs.  
- **Color tokens:** neutral slate backgrounds; primary gradient (purple→teal); priority chips (high=rose, medium=amber, low=emerald).  
- **Typography:** Inter/SF; sizes: 12/14/16 body, 20/24/32 headings; semi-bold for metric digits.  
- **Icons:** lucide-react; consistent 18/20px in lists, 24px in cards.  
- **Micro-interactions:** hover lift on cards, progress ticks, confetti for streak milestones.
