# TaskMaster Pro — User Experience

## Global patterns
- **Top navigation:** Dashboard · Tasks · Projects · Notes · Habits · Calendar · Analytics · Focus Mode.
- **Quick Actions bar** (visible on Dashboard & Tasks): Add Task, Quick Note, Start Timer.
- **Command Palette** (⌘/Ctrl-K): jump to anything; create task/note/habit from anywhere.
- **Light/Dark parity** with a one-tap toggle; accessible contrast; subtle glass cards with soft elevation.
- **Keyboard-first**: “T” to add task, “N” note, “H” habit, “F” focus session, “/” search.

## Module summaries & exemplary flows
- **Dashboard**  
  Morning snapshot: tasks due/overdue, active projects, today’s habit targets, time tracked. One-click **“Start Focus Session”** on the top suggestion. Micro-wins (confetti tick for first completion).

- **Tasks**  
  Filter chips (Status, Priority, Project, Due). Kanban and List views. Each task shows estimate, due date, tags, recurrence, and checklist. **Inline edit** + **snooze**.  
  *Flow:* paste a paragraph → “Extract tasks” → agent proposes subtasks with estimates; accept all or cherry-pick.

- **Projects**  
  Compact cards with progress bars, due date, budget, members. “View Tasks” drills into scoped task board. **Project brief** (goal, KPIs, risks) sits above the task list.

- **Notes**  
  Markdown-first editor with `/slash` menu for checklists, callouts, and linked tasks. **“Convert bullets to tasks”** proposes a task bundle with inferred priorities/dates.

- **Habits**  
  Daily target overview, streaks (today/avg/longest), completion rate. Habits can **attach to projects** (e.g., “Write for 30 min” linked to “Launch blog”). Check-in widgets and reminders.

- **Calendar**  
  Day/Week view of tasks & events. **Upcoming Deadlines** ribbon with priority chips. Drag to reschedule tasks; conflicts auto-flagged.

- **Analytics**  
  Trend cards: completion rate, daily tasks velocity, time tracked, **productivity score** (transparent recipe). Task distribution by priority and project. “What improved this week?” insights from agent.

- **Focus Mode**  
  Large timer, distraction-free layout. “Quick Start” shows top two high-leverage tasks (4h, 2h in screenshots). Logs sessions to analytics automatically; optional **site blocker hooks**.
