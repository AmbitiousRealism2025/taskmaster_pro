### Quality Assurance Master Architecture
```typescript
// Quality Scoring Algorithm
const overallScore = Math.round(
  (coverageScore * 0.3) +      // Test coverage weight
  (e2eScore * 0.25) +          // E2E testing weight
  (accessibilityScore * 0.25) + // Accessibility weight
  (performanceScore * 0.2)     // Performance weight
)

// Quality Status Determination
EXCELLENT: score >= 95    // Production ready
GOOD: score >= 85        // Minor improvements needed
NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT: >= 70 // Several areas require attention
CRITICAL: score < 70     // Immediate action required
```

### E2E Testing Framework
```typescript
// Critical User Journey Scenarios
const CRITICAL_USER_JOURNEYS = [
  'auth-001': User Registration and Login Flow

  'rt-001': Real-time Collaboration Multi-tab Sync
  'perf-001': Performance Benchmark Validation
  'a11y-001': Accessibility Compliance Validation
]
```

### Accessibility Compliance System
```typescript
// WCAG 2.1 AA Validation Rules
