## üîÑ Document Usage Flow

### For Each Subgroup Implementation:

1. **Start**: Check SUBGROUP_PROGRESS.md for next subgroup
2. **Load Primary**: Load specific phase context document
3. **Load Tests**: Load relevant test file section
4. **Check Enhancements**: Load any applicable enhancement documents
5. **Implement**: Follow IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md
6. **Track**: Update SUBGROUP_PROGRESS.md
7. **Compact**: Follow IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md compaction process

### Document Priority During Implementation:

**Must Load** (for each subgroup):
- Specific subgroup context document
- Relevant test specifications
- IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md (for process)

**Load if Listed** (in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md):
- Applicable security enhancements
- Applicable performance optimizations
- Applicable architecture improvements

**Reference Only** (don't load unless needed):
- Original product documentation
- UI examples
- Historical planning documents

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Enhanced Files**: Always use the enhanced version if it exists (e.g., Phase3_Production_Tests_ENHANCED.md)
2. **Supplementary Docs**: Only load those specifically listed for your current subgroup
3. **Context Management**: Loading too many documents will require early compaction
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update tracking documents BEFORE compaction
