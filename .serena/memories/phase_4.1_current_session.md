# Sub-Phase 4.1 Foundation Stability - Session Initialization

**Date**: September 2, 2025
**Phase**: Sub-Phase 4.1 Foundation Stability - "Make it compile, make it secure"
**Status**: INITIATED

## Session Context
- User completed compact process from organizational phase
- Beginning systematic foundation stability implementation
- Focus on critical production blockers before optimization work

## Active Workstreams
1. **TypeScript Compilation** - Primary blocker (20+ errors)
2. **Test Suite Stabilization** - Production readiness (4 failures)  
3. **Security Infrastructure** - Environment hardening
4. **CSRF Protection** - Production security requirement

## Validation Gates Target
- TypeScript: Clean compilation (0 errors)
- Tests: All passing (0 failures)
- Security: Environment audit clean
- CSRF: Protection active and validated

## Current Session Todo Priority
Starting with TypeScript compilation assessment as the foundational blocker that prevents all build and optimization work.

**Next Action**: Comprehensive TypeScript error analysis and systematic resolution approach.
