## Objectives
Transform TaskMaster Pro into a production-ready application with enterprise-grade security, performance optimization, comprehensive monitoring, and automated deployment pipelines.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Lighthouse optimization (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
- [ ] Bundle optimization with code splitting
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- [ ] Memory leak prevention and monitoring
- [ ] Image optimization pipeline
- [ ] Critical CSS extraction
- [ ] Resource hints (preconnect, prefetch, preload)

### 2. Security Hardening
- [ ] CSP headers configuration
- [ ] Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting with Redis
- [ ] DDoS protection mechanisms
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] CSRF tokens implementation
- [ ] Secrets management with environment variables
- [ ] Security audit compliance

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Code quality gates
- [ ] Multi-stage Docker builds
- [ ] Container security scanning
- [ ] Automated dependency updates
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Error tracking with Sentry
- [ ] Structured logging with Winston
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- [ ] Custom dashboards
- [ ] Alerting rules
- [ ] Distributed tracing
- [ ] User behavior analytics

### Step 2: Security Layer (Day 3-4)
1. Configure security headers
2. Implement CSP policies
3. Add rate limiting
4. Setup input validation
5. Implement authentication hardening
6. Add security monitoring

### Step 3: CI/CD Setup (Day 5-6)
1. Create GitHub Actions workflows
2. Setup Docker containerization
3. Configure multi-environment deployments
4. Implement automated testing
5. Add quality gates
6. Setup rollback procedures

### Step 4: Monitoring Infrastructure (Day 7-8)
1. Integrate error tracking
2. Setup structured logging
3. Create health checks
4. Configure metrics collection
5. Build monitoring dashboards
6. Setup alerting

### Step 5: Testing & Validation (Day 9-10)
1. Performance testing
2. Security audit
3. Load testing
4. Deployment testing
