## üöÄ Next Steps for Implementation

### Before Starting Subgroup 1:
1. [ ] Initialize Git repository
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: Initial commit with complete planning documentation"
   ```

2. [ ] Create development branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev
   ```

3. [ ] Set up remote repository (GitHub)
   ```bash
   git remote add origin [repository-url]
   git push -u origin main
   git push -u origin dev
   ```

4. [ ] Create initial checkpoint
   ```bash
   git tag -a "planning-complete" -m "All planning documentation complete"
   git push --tags
   ```

5. [ ] Start Subgroup 1 implementation
   - Load `context_docs/phase1/01_infrastructure_foundation.md`
   - Load `Phase1_Foundation_Tests.md` (Tests 1-6)
   - Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Reminders

### MANDATORY Rules:
1. **COMPACT AFTER EACH SUBGROUP** - No exceptions!
2. **One subgroup at a time** - Never attempt multiple
3. **Test everything** - 100% pass rate before moving on
4. **Document decisions** - Update progress tracker
5. **Monitor context** - Never exceed 75%

### Success Criteria:
- Each subgroup fully implemented
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Git commit created
- Compaction completed
- Ready for next subgroup
