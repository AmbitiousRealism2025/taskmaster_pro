# TaskMaster Pro - CLI Adaptation Strategy

## üö® Critical Context: Claude Code CLI vs Desktop

You're using **Claude Code CLI**, which doesn't support MCP servers. The TaskMaster Pro project was designed assuming MCP server availability, but we can adapt.

## üìä Impact Assessment

### What We're Missing (MCP Servers):
1. **Memory MCP** - Was for persistent context across 12 compaction points
2. **Playwright MCP** - Was for running E2E tests
3. **Context7 MCP** - Was for framework documentation lookup
4. **Serena MCP** - Was for semantic code analysis

### What We CAN Do in CLI:
‚úÖ **Full file operations** (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit)
‚úÖ **Bash execution** (including npm, git, testing commands)
‚úÖ **Search tools** (Grep, Glob)
‚úÖ **Web capabilities** (WebSearch, WebFetch)
‚úÖ **Task management** (TodoWrite)
‚úÖ **Sub-agents** (Task tool with specialized agents)

## üîÑ Adapted Workflow for CLI

### 1. Compaction Strategy (Without Memory MCP)
Instead of using memory MCP for persistence, we'll use:
- **Git commits** as checkpoints after each subgroup
- **SUBGROUP_PROGRESS.md** as our state tracking
- **Context management** via aggressive file documentation
- **Session notes** in dedicated files

### 2. Testing Strategy (Without Playwright MCP)
We can still do TDD with:
- **Vitest** for unit tests (via `npm run test`)
- **Playwright** installed as project dependency (not MCP)
- **Native bash execution** for test running
- **Test results** saved to files for tracking

### 3. Documentation Strategy (Without Context7 MCP)
- **WebSearch** for framework documentation
- **WebFetch** for specific documentation pages
- **Local context docs** already created in project
- **Task agents** for complex searches

### 4. Code Analysis (Without Serena MCP)
- **Grep/Glob** for code searching
- **Task agents** for analysis tasks
- **Native Claude reasoning** for code understanding
- **Manual tracking** in documentation files

## üìã Revised Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
```bash
# We can still do everything needed:
1. Create Next.js project structure
2. Set up TypeScript configuration
3. Install dependencies (including Playwright)
4. Create component library
5. Run tests via bash commands
```

### Key Adaptations:

#### For Compaction Points:
```bash
# After each subgroup:
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete Subgroup X: [Description]"
echo "Session context: [details]" >> SESSION_NOTES.md
# Then start fresh conversation if needed
```

#### For Testing:
```bash
# Install Playwright as dependency
npm install -D @playwright/test vitest @testing-library/react

# Run tests directly
npm run test
npx playwright test
```

#### For State Persistence:
- Use `SESSION_STATE.json` file
- Update `SUBGROUP_PROGRESS.md` religiously
- Create checkpoint commits frequently
- Document decisions in markdown files

## üéØ Can We Still Build TaskMaster Pro?

**YES!** We can build the entire project, but with these adjustments:

1. **More manual tracking** - Document everything in files
2. **Frequent git commits** - Our "memory" system
3. **Direct test execution** - Via bash instead of MCP
4. **File-based state** - Instead of memory MCP
5. **Aggressive documentation** - Compensate for lack of persistence

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Proceed with CLI (Adapted Workflow)
- Accept the limitations
- Use file-based tracking
- Implement with more manual checkpoints
- Complete project with native tools

### Option 2: Switch to Claude Desktop
- Install Claude Desktop app
- Transfer this project there
- Get full MCP server support
- Follow original workflow

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Start implementation in CLI
- Do foundation work (Phase 1)
- Switch to Desktop for complex phases
- Use CLI for simpler tasks

## üìù CLI-Specific Benefits

Actually, the CLI has some advantages:
- **Faster responses** (no MCP overhead)
- **Simpler debugging** (fewer moving parts)
- **Direct control** (no abstraction layers)
- **Scriptable** (can automate with bash)

## ü§î Recommendation

Since you're already set up in CLI, I recommend **Option 1: Proceed with adapted workflow**. The project is absolutely doable without MCP servers - we just need to be more disciplined about:
- Git commits after each subgroup
- File-based state tracking
- Manual test execution
- Documentation of progress

The core development work (writing Next.js code, creating components, implementing features) is identical regardless of MCP availability.

## üí° Decision Point

Would you like to:
1. **Continue in CLI** with adapted workflow (totally feasible)
2. **Switch to Desktop** for MCP support (if you have it)
3. **Get more details** about specific adaptations needed

The TaskMaster Pro project can definitely be built in CLI - we just need to adjust our approach to compaction and testing!
